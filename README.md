# MechaCar Statistical Analysis Using R

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression MPG](/Resources/linreg_mpg.PNG)

 - The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were "vehicle_length" and "ground_clearance."
 - The p-value (5.35e-11) is much smaller than a significance level of 0.05. This means that the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the statistical analysis provides sufficient evidence that the null hypothesis is not true.
 - The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively as the r-squared value is 0.7149. This means that there is about a 71.5% chance that future data will be able to fit this model.
